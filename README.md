# Civil Engineering, Geodesy, and Transport Projects

This repository hosts projects and scripts from my Master's degree focused on:

- **Geodesy:** Mobile LiDAR data processing, spatial analysis
- **Transport:** Road network resilience, climate risk impact assessments
- **Civil Engineering:** Road intersection analysis, structural simulations

## Setup

Install required Python packages:

```bash
python geodesy/mobile_lidar_processing.py
python transport/transport_network_resilience.py
python civil_engineering/road_intersection_analysis.py
